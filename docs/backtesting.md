## Modules

The backtesting package is composed of a few focused modules:

- `backtest_engine` – glue code that wires together universe selection,
  alpha models, portfolio construction and execution into a Backtrader run.
- `base_strategy` – common bookkeeping and helpers used by all provided
  strategies.
- `commission` – cost models for simulating broker commissions and spreads.
- `indicators` – reusable signal and technical indicator implementations.
- `optimization_engine` – genetic‑algorithm tooling for parameter searches.
- `portfolio` – utilities for combining the results of several strategies and
  producing performance reports.
- `strategies` – ready‑to‑use Backtrader `Strategy` subclasses.
- `universe` – helpers for building trading universes (e.g. most liquid symbols).


`pwb_toolbox.backtesting.strategies` ships a collection of portfolio templates
with different rebalancing rules and signal expectations:

- **DailyEqualWeightPortfolio** – holds all assets with a long signal and
  allocates equal weight each day.
- **DailyLeveragePortfolio** – goes long with fixed leverage when the signal is
  1 and is otherwise flat.
- **EqualWeightEntryExitPortfolio** – opens equally‑weighted positions when an
  entry condition triggers and leaves existing winners untouched.
- **DynamicEqualWeightPortfolio** – event‑driven equal‑weight portfolio that can
  rebalance on any signal change or only when the set of long assets changes.
- **MonthlyLongShortPortfolio** – once per month allocates half of the leverage
  to longs and half to shorts based on a universe‑aware signal.
- **MonthlyLongShortQuantilePortfolio** – monthly rebalance that ranks assets
  by a per‑asset signal and goes long the strongest and short the weakest.
- **MonthlyRankedEqualWeightPortfolio** – monthly equal‑weight portfolio with an
  optional ranking step and support for keeping only the top *N* assets.
- **QuarterlyTopMomentumPortfolio** – every quarter concentrates exposure in the
  single asset with the strongest recent momentum.
- **RollingSemesterLongShortPortfolio** – semi‑annual rebalancing template that
  accumulates long/short signals over six‑month windows.
- **WeeklyLongShortDecilePortfolio** – rebalances weekly and trades the top and
  bottom deciles of a signal distribution.
- **WeightedAllocationPortfolio** – turns user‑provided weights into integer
  share positions under a leverage constraint.
